Update: I accidentally uploaded the .pdf and .ipynb for my PHYS 641 Assignment 2 instead of PHYS 512 Assignment 2. I originally uploaded everything on here on September 26th, now it's Octorber 1st and I'm fixing the mistake. The plots for this assignment uploaded correctly the first time.

All plots are shown (with the code) in the Jupyter Notebook "Assignment_2" (in .pdf and .ipynb format).
